const qrCodeData = await deviceAuthenticationService.generateQRCode('target-device-id');

// Process QR code on target device
const authSession = await deviceAuthenticationService.processQRCode(qrCodeData);

// Complete authentication
const response = await deviceAuthenticationService.respondToChallenge(
  authSession.sessionId,
  verificationInput
);

const isVerified = await deviceAuthenticationService.verifyAuthenticationResponse(
  authSession.sessionId,
